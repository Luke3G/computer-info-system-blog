    <p>A object that I belive that will come out would be a refigartor that has the fridge the freezer but also has a
        oven, blender, etc... all the cooking needs but also a dish washer. The most amazing part is this isnt going to
        be 15 ft long it will be the size of a one door fridge.</p>

        function myFunction() {
            var txt;
            var person = prompt("Please enter your name:", "Harry Potter");
            if (person == null || person == "") {
                txt = "User cancelled the prompt.";
            } else {
                txt = "Hello " + person + "! How are you today?";
            }
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
