    <p>A object that I belive that will come out would be a refigartor that has the fridge the freezer but also has a
        oven, blender, etc... all the cooking needs but also a dish washer. The most amazing part is this isnt going to
        be 15 ft long it will be the size of a one door fridge.</p>
