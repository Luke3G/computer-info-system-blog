    <p>The best way to protect your laptop, computer, phone, etc... would be in my opnion a VPN it protects your ip adress. Which is what most people who fish need to get your information I will say that it is not full proof people can still find ways through a VPN but my opinon it is the best to go with.</p>

    <p>A object that I belive that will come out would be a refigartor that has the fridge the freezer but also has a
        oven, blender, etc... all the cooking needs but also a dish washer. The most amazing part is this isnt going to
        be 15 ft long it will be the size of a one door fridge.</p>
